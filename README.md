# 3x+1 Checker

## What is 3x+1?
[3x+1 (otherwise known as the Collatz Conjecture)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is a mathematical problem that to this day is unsolved. So far mathematicians believe that all positive integers following the same 2 rules will always end up in a 4 2 1 loop.

## What are these rules?
### If the number is even
- `Divide the number by 2`
### If the number is odd
- `Multiply the number by 3`
- `Add 1 to the number`

## I don't understand any of this stuff, is there a simple explanation?
Yes! I personally learned about the 3x+1 problem through [Veritasium's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg) on it which can be seen by clicking on the hyperlink, or at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg
